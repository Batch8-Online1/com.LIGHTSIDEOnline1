Testing the room reservation application by using Cucumber BDD

main functionalities for smoke tests:
1. login with given file 
2. go to  hunt page
3. select available date and time 
4. select an available room
5. confirm the reservation 
6. check the rezervation on schedule page which show all reservations 



note: when trying to search for available room after entering date and time ,
the search button does not work for chrome browser ,
i tried many things to solve this problem , my final solution is changing browser to firefox. 
if you can find a better way , fix it .
